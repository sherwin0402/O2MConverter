MoBL_ARMS_module6_7_CMC.osim:
  - the original model

MoBL_ARMS_model_for_testing_opensim.osim:
  - deviation and flexion are locked
  - modified translation 2 of 'groundthorax' joint: added a constant value of 1 so that torso isn't inside the floor

MoBL_ARMS_model_for_testing_mujoco.osim:
  - deviation and flexion are locked
  - modified translation 2 of 'groundthorax' joint: added a constant value of 1 so that torso isn't inside the floor
  - made all path point names unique in muscles

MoBL_ARMS_model_for_testing_opensim_no_wrap.osim:
  - deviation and flexion are locked
  - modified translation 2 of 'groundthorax' joint: added a constant value of 1 so that torso isn't inside the floor
  - wrap objects and paths deleted

MoBL_ARMS_model_for_mujoco.osim:
  - modified translation 2 of 'groundthorax' joint: added a constant value of 1 so that torso isn't inside the floor
  - made all path point names unique in muscles
